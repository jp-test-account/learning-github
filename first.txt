hey
hello
this is learning github
and it's component, where
each line is longer than the previous one
oh haven't you figured it out yet, then please 
study this poem / story / anything with intense care
Yes, this file will still follow the same code pattern, 
meaning, the next line will be longer than the first line
well, why am i doing this, because i want to see, how github mearges branch
if needed, well then see you at experiment branch, bye from master branch, see ya
still adding more lines, trying to jot down more and more concepts in a single file
well, yes next file will be a real coding one, trying to figure out how really code merges
and also getting the idea how exactly smart is github, and i know git is really cool but is github too?
no rule, 
study this poem / story / anything with intense care
will this work?
how to push branch to github?
wondering with lotts of changes
in this file
now next commit will try to merge the files
